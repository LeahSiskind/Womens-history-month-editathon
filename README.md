Closing the Gap: Women's History Month Edit-a-thon

BACKGROUND
The White House Gender Policy Council & the White House Domestic Policy Council are hosting a Wikipedia Edit-a-thon with Wikimedia DC to improve historical representation of women. The goal of this event is to mark Women's History Month by collaborating with a select group of youth organizations to address the gender content gap in Wikipedia entries. Shockingly only 10% of Wikipedia editors are women, and only 20% of Wikipedia profiles are about women, which leads to a systemic bias in how we document history. The solution is to motivate women and girls to create new content, expand the breadth of profiles, find reference materials to cite and fix the credit bias, and remove unconsciously biased language.

EVENT
The Edit-a-thon is a virtual event where girls can edit, improve, and/or create Wikipedia content to recognize the contributions of underrepresented women in history. A list of topics will be created in advance so the girls can use the entire event to edit and improve Wikipedia. 

Mentors from partner organizations will undergo training in advance to ensure that allotted time is used efficiently. Representatives from the United States Digital Service will be there to help troubleshoot any issues with editing Wikipedia.
